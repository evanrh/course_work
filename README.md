# Evan Hastings - Classes

In this repo there are several folders each from a different class I have taken
Below is a manifest describing what kind of material is in each folder/what the class was covering

2150 - Software Devlopment Foundations (Basic software engineering principles like OO design, design by contract, and patterns)

More to come...
